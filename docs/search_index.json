Bret Staudt Willet, Ph.D. 2022 Dedication For my family, E3, who continually remind me of what really matters. Acknowledgments Thanks In my own journey through data analytics, I have benefited tremendously from (and wouldn’t be here without) daily chats with the so-called Koehler Diaspora (Josh Rosenberg, Mete Akcaoglu, Spencer Greenhalgh, and of course Matthew Koehler). 0.0.1 I Honor Native Land Tallahassee Native Land I live and work in Tallahassee, Florida, on the traditional land of the Apalachee, Muscogee, and Miccosukee Peoples. I completed my graduate school work while living in Lancaster County PA, on the traditional land of the Susquehannock People, learning from the faculty at Michigan State University in East Lansing MI, built on the traditional land of the Peoria, Anishinabewaki, Odawa, and Sauk Peoples. I was born and lived my first two decades of life in the Roanoke Valley VA, on the traditional land of the Tutelo People. I share these land acknowledgements to demonstrate my commitment to learning and working to dismantle the ongoing legacies of settler colonialism. I recognize that these lands that have been important to my life remain scarred by the histories and ongoing legacies of settler colonial violence, dispossession, and removal. In spite of all of this, and with tremendous resilience, these Indigenous Nations have remained deeply connected to this territory, to their families, to their communities, and to their cultural ways of life. I recognize the ongoing relationships of care that these Indigenous Nations maintain with this land and extend my gratitude as I live and work as a humble and respectful guest upon their territory. I encourage you to learn about and amplify the contemporary work of the Indigenous nations whose land you are on and to endeavor to support Indigenous sovereignty in all the ways that you can. To start learning, I have found the Native Land map to be fascinating to explore, and the Honor Native Land guide from the U.S. Department of Arts &amp; Culture has many useful resources. Finally, if you are in the Tallahassee area, you may find this list of resources from the Decolonize FSU group to be helpful. Tools This book was created with the bookdown package (Xie, 2021a) in R, which in turn was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie, 2021b). 0.1 About the Author I am an Assistant Professor of Instructional Systems &amp; Learning Technologies at Florida State University. My research investigates self-directed learning, especially by teachers. I’m most interested in what happens when our students, learners, and trainees finish the instruction and training we design for them. What do they do after they walk out the door or log off? How do they continue to develop the knowledge, skills, and abilities they need? Where do they look for resources? Who do they talk to?

Students will get hands-on experience with small data sets and will learn how big data sets are collected and used. The book will explore the role that analytics plays in education and related fields, identify the types of questions that might be answered via both quantitative and qualitative analytics, and engage in analytic- related problem solving. This book will examine case studies and provide students with practice using a variety of tools and services that can help them collect and analyze learning and web data. There are no pre-requisites, and although data will be used prior experience with statistics or research design is not necessary.

Introduction 1.1 Book Description This book addresses the collection and use of data for decision making and assessment in learning and human performance contexts. Students will get hands-on experience with small data sets and will learn how big data sets are collected and used. The book will explore the role that analytics plays in education and related fields, identify the types of questions that might be answered via both quantitative and qualitative analytics, and engage in analytic- related problem solving. This book will examine case studies and provide students with practice using a variety of tools and services that can help them collect and analyze learning and web data. There are no pre-requisites, and although data will be used prior experience with statistics or research design is not necessary. 1.2 Learning Objectives At the completion of this book, students will be able to: Discuss major concepts related to analytics. Discuss the application of analytics to the fields of instructional systems design and performance technology. Apply the major concepts related to analytics to solving real world problems. Identify real world problems that might be addressed via analytics. Align problems with appropriate data sources, data collection methods, and analytic methods. Select the most appropriate analytic tool for a given context. Collect analytic data in a systematic manner. Analyze and interpret systematically collected analytic data. Develop context-appropriate reports that indicate how analytics address a particular problem. 1.3 A Note on Data Privacy Your personal data is valuable and important, which is why it is often collected by the digital tools you use in your educational activities. To better understand how and why your data is collected, the potential risks of this collection, and how to better protect your personal data, consider asking yourself the following questions: What types of personal data do you think are collected through your use of digital tools for educational activities? What value does your personal data have for different contexts and entities? Consider how your data might be valued by your instructor, the institution, yourself, and companies. Who owns your personal data, who can sell it, and who can use it? Do you have concerns about how your personal data can be used? If so, what are they? Are there aspects of your identity or life that you feel would put you in a place of special vulnerability if certain data were known about you or used against you? If after asking yourself these questions you have concerns, I invite you to reach out to me to discuss them. I may not have easy answers to the questions or concerns that you bring to me (often in these matters no one has these answers), but I will happily explore them further with you or find someone more knowledgeable who can help answer your questions.
